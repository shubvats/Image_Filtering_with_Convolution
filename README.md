**Image Filtering using Convolution**

**Description:**
This C/C++ program reads in raw format images and performs filtering by convolving them with small operators of 3x3 and 5x5 coefficients. It implements differentiation by difference, using edge operators such as the Sobel Operator in both horizontal and vertical directions. The resulting images are saved in raw format and converted to jpg/png format as well.

**Tools Used:**
- C/C++ programming language
- Standard libraries: `<stdio.h>`, `<stdlib.h>`

**How to Run:**
1. Compile the program using a C/C++ compiler.
2. Ensure the input raw image files are accessible and specify their paths in the program.
3. Run the compiled executable.

**Input Images:**
1. A raw format image created in Photoshop with a circle of dark intensity.
2. "unesco-1.png" available in the file page of CANVAS.
3. One selected image in raw format.

**Output Images:**
The resulting images will be saved in raw format and converted to jpg/png format. There will be 15 resulting images in total, including:
- Three source images
- Horizontal and vertical difference images for both 3x3 and 5x5 size filters

**Note:**
Ensure the file paths for input and output images are correctly specified in the program before running.
